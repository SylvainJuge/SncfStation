--- Main features ---
  - parse whole table and display it as ascii

--- Code & Design ---
- use jdk7 try with resources
x allow execution without packaging for faster development

- create unit tests for each feature
    - add testng framework for test execution
    - test xml parsing with a static file with known data
    - test TrainRecord creation and invariants
    - test code on actual server

- split code on main program aspects
    - retrieve source file : from web, or from static file if offline
    - parse file and build a representation of its content (List<TrainRecord>)
    - TrainRecord invariants and builder pattern

--- Enhancements ---
  x bundle everything as a single executable .jar
  x allow for offline mode execution (test when not online...)
  - allow for offline mode retrieve (save file after download, for later offline use)
  - allow for another station
  - allow for departure and arrivals
  - do a statistical analysis of which train arrives at which platform
